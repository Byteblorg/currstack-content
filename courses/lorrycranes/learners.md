Safe Work Practices – Risk Assessment (Lifting Plan)
Permit to Work
• Formal system to control certain types of hazardous work,
which includes lifting operations. (Under WSH(Construction) Regulation Section 10)
• Approved by an authorised person, typically project
manager who shall have oversight on the entire workprocess so as to avoid any situation of conflicting orincompatible work being carried out at the sametime.
• The work can commence only after the permit is approved.
Safe Work Practices – Load Charts
Load Charts
• Crane operator must know how to read andunderstand the crane’s load chart(s) and must notexceed the capacity ratings.
• Load charts must be posted on the crane and/or thethey are visible when the
operator’s cab so thatoperator is at work
• Load charts must be maintained so that they remainlegible. Do not operate a crane without a legible loadchart.
•
If a crane is equipped with a remote control, the loadcharts must be at a level visible to the operator fromthe ground.
Safe Work Practices – Load Charts
Load Charts
Gather all necessary information about the loadand refer to the load capacity chart of the craneto determine lift capacity and suitability.
Common terms:• Safe Working Load (SWL)• Working Load Limit (WLL)• Minimum Breaking Load (MBL)• Safety Factors (SF)• Proof Load (PL)

The closer the loader is to the body of the crane thehigher will be the safe working load of the equipment.
Safe Work Practices – Load Charts
Most load charts has 4 Basic areas of information:
Capacity chart provides the lifting capacity for a givenboom angle and length.
Range chart is useful for determining if the crane will becapable of placing a given load at a specific height.
Operating area chart indicates any lifting restrictionsbased on the position of the crane with respect to thecarrier.
Load chart provides important information regarding thecrane’s operation.

Winch
Proper spooling of wire rope on the winch drumprevents damages to the wire rope such as crushingand/or scuffing.
Loosely wrapped wire rope need to be unspooledand properly re-spooled on the winch to preventdamage.
Crushing, from spooling problems is one of the mostcommon causes of damaged wire rope on a crane.
Conduct Routine Checks – Check lorry crane visually for any damage or defects
Wire Rope
The diameter of a wire rope must be regularly measured(and recorded) to check for wear.
When the diameter is less than the nominal value forthe wire rope, do not use. (Check with manufacturer’sminimum allowable number.)

Set up crane
Check ground suitability
lorry crane manufacturers provide the followingMostinformation on the loads imposed by the machine on theground in various operating and set up configuration of thelorry crane:
• Maximum vertical load per stabiliser• Dimensions of stabiliser support plate/pad• Ground-level pressure on stabiliser support plate/pad
76
77
Set up crane – Check ground suitability
The use of floats under outrigger pads greatly increase the safetyof the lifting operation. By increasing its size of the footprint, theconcentrated load on the grounds decreases,thus alsodecreases the potential for toppling.
The float must be strong enough to withstand the load.
It is essential that stabilisers be deployed in the manner specifiedby the lorry crane manufacturer.

Set up crane – Check ground suitability
On a slope
Adjust the outriggers to keep the crane horizontal. Tires orstabilisers should not set up closer that 1.5 times the depth ofan excavation in sandy or gravel soil; 1 times the depth of solidor compact soil or next to a cellar or basement walls.
Set up crane – Check ground suitability
Near excavation
Strengthen excavations’ supports. Position and orient the lorrycrane to lift over the proper lifting quadrants.
Set up crane – Check ground suitability
Loose soil
Do not use individual loose timbers as they are a major causeof accidents.
Timber must be sufficient dimensions and strength to transmitthe applied loads to the ground. Use firm, good quality, largewooden planks to distribute the load and reduce the weight onthe soil.
Bolted cribbing timbers prevent rollout.

Consideration must be given to the length of time that thelorry crane will be erected in one position and the likelydeterioration of the support ground or foundation over time.
Consideration must be given when assessing thesegrounds:
• Underground services• Un-compacted fill• Open excavations• Basements• Proximity to canals and rivers• Changes to site conditions during construction• Slope and mole of ground
82
Set up crane – Check ground suitability
If the assessment indicates that the ground has insufficientbearing capacity to accept loads imposed by the lorry loader,additional measures must be take before the lorry crane can beset up.
Set up crane
Position crane for work application andstability according to procedures
The major cause of crane accidents is the crane tipping over.
The causes of tip-over accidents are mostly due to crane notset up according to manufacturer’s specifications and notadhering to load capacity charts.

Determine that lifts are within the capacity of thecrane by using a load chart
Before attempting a lift, gather all necessary informationabout the load and the height to place the load and referto the load capacity charts of the crane to determine liftcapacity and suitability.

The four basic areas of information provided by thefollowing load charts are:
• Capacity chart provides the lifting capacity for agiven
boom angle and boom length.
• Range chart is useful for determining whetherthecrane will be capable of placing a given load at aspecific height.
• Operating area chart indicates any lifting restrictionsbased on the position of the crane with respect to thecarrier.

Lift and transfer load – Determine that lifts are within the capacity of the crane by using a load

1. Calculate the total load to be imposed on the crane.
Remember to include any load deductions along with the netload.
2. Determine the minimum boom height required to make liftsafely. In this example, the building is 30 feet talk the loadwith rigging requires another 10 feet. The hook andassociated hardware is 3 feet, and we have determined thatwe want at least 5 feet for free operating room. If the cranehas an anti-two-block device installed, an additional heightwill be required.
3. Determine the minimum radius at which the crane can makethe lift. The closest the crane can get to the building is 8 feet,the distance from the center of rotation to the stabiliser pad.Next is the 15-foot wide porch, and added to that is the 10feet from the edge of the building to the centre of the load.

2. Draw a vertical line at 23 feet of radius, which representsthe side of the building. The intersection of these twolines is the corner of the building.

The endless sling can be made by splicing togetherthe ends of a piece of fiber line or chain/wire rope toform an endless loop. The endless sling is easy tohandle and is frequently used as a choker hitch.
Single-leg sling
Bridle sling
A single-leg sling, commonly referred to as a STRAP,can be constructed by forming a spliced eye in eachend of a piece of fiber line or wire rope. Sometimes theends of a piece of wire rope are spliced into eyesaround thimbles, and one eye is fastened to a hookwith a shackle. With this arrangement,the shackleand hook are removable. A single-legsling also may be used as a choker hitch.
Bridle slings are usually made from single-leg slingsusing a master link.Three or four-legged slings can beconstruct the same way with a masterlink and sub-links forthe 3-4single-leg slings.

Additionalforce is imposed in order to start a loadmoving by using the hoisting system. This also meansaddition stress is imposed on the crane’s structure.
How much additional force imposed depends on theweight of the load and how fast it is moved.
Loads started and stopped slowly will not exert as muchstress on the crane as those that are moved rapidly.

Lift and transfer load – Monitor load movement to ensure safety to personnel and load, and
